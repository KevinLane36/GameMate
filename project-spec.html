                <h3>Description of Project</h3>
                <p>Game Mate is an interactive web page application that matches users with a potential game.
                    The user puts in different metrics of their personality, and using those metrics, a video game is 
                    recommended for the user. The program uses JavaScript to filter through different "pages" or div elements.
                     The information that the user inputs is turned into data values and arrays. If/then/else statements filter through the data 
                     and test for differing conditions, then output the correct game for the users.

                <h3>New Concepts</h3>
                <p><ul>Changing Div element values</ul>
                    <ul>HTML Manipulation</ul>
                    <ul>Uses of the HTML button</ul>
                    <ul>Filtering through arrays to compare two arrays</ul>
                    <ul>Concept of "Radio" forms in HTML</ul>
                    <ul>Checking, using TypeScript, to see if a form button has been checked or not</ul>
                    <ul>Changing attributes of HTML divs to make their display type none or inline</ul>
                    <ul>Console Log usage</ul>
                    <ul>use of parse Int to change string into number</ul>
                    <ul>Learned how to cup stack. This was the most useful, useless knowledge I have ever learned.</ul>

            <div>
                <h3>Challenges Overcome</h3>
                <p><ul>Learning how to pull a value from HTML elements in JavaScript. I ended up finding a "check" option in JavaScript to check if a radio input has been selected.</ul>
                    <ul>I had to figure out how to change "pages" without leaving the same HTML. I solved this by changing the div display trait to none or inline when I wanted it to display or not.</ul>
                    <ul>I spent 2 solid hours trying to figure out why my button stopped working. It took four TAs and another hour to find out it was just in the wrong div. This was a BIG challenge with an easy solution.</ul>
                    <ul>I overcame the temptation to sleep during all of Hack110.</ul>
